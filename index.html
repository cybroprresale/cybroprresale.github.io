        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7"><a href="https://cybroprresale.github.io" class="text-primary">Cybro Presale</a> is a critical phase in the launch of the Cybro Token, designed to engage early investors and create a foundation for the project’s ecosystem. This phase allows participants to purchase tokens before the official public launch, often at a discounted rate. Understanding the dynamics of the presale is essential for potential investors and stakeholders.
<br>
<br>Purpose of <a href="https://cybro.io/en" class="text-primary">Cybro Presale</a><br>
<br>1. Fundraising<br>
<br>The primary goal of the presale is to raise funds to support the development and marketing of the Cybro ecosystem. This capital is crucial for building the platform, hiring talent, and executing the project’s roadmap.<br>
<br>2. Community Building<br>
<br>Engaging early investors helps build a community around Cybro Token. These early adopters often become advocates for the project, spreading awareness and driving future adoption.<br>
<br>3. Market Validation<br>
<br>Conducting a presale allows the project team to gauge interest and validate the market demand for Cybro Token. Successful fundraising can indicate strong community support and potential for growth.<br>
<br>Structure of Cybro Presale<br>
<br>1. Phases of the Presale<br>
<br>Initial Phase: This phase typically offers the lowest token price to incentivize early investment.<br>
<br>Subsequent Phases: As the presale progresses, token prices may increase, rewarding early participants while still providing opportunities for later investors.<br>
<br>2. Token Allocation<br>
<br>A specific portion of the total token supply is allocated for the presale. This allocation is often limited to ensure scarcity and maintain value.<br>
<br>3. Hard and Soft Caps<br>
<br>Hard Cap: The maximum amount of funds the presale aims to raise. Once this cap is reached, the presale will close.
<br>Soft Cap: The minimum amount of funds needed to proceed with the project. If this cap is not met, the presale may be canceled or adjusted.
<br>Benefits of Participating in Cybro Presale
<br>1. Discounted Pricing
<br>Participants in the presale often receive tokens at a lower price than during the public launch. This early investment can yield significant returns if the token appreciates in value.

<br>3. Fund Transfer

<br>4. Claiming Tokens
<br>After the presale concludes, tokens are usually distributed to participants’ wallets. The distribution timeline and process will be communicated by the project team.
